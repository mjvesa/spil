Spil
====

A minimal Lisp IDE web app. Probably will use:

    * Vaadin
    * JScheme


Workflow
========

Run make to make. The makefile needs to be modified to suit
your environment.

Purpose
=======
See how well Scheme can be used to implement Vaadin applications. Attempt to
strip everything that's not essential from Vaadin and see how small it can get.
